## ðŸ“˜ What is C++?

C++ is a **general-purpose, object-oriented programming language** that provides high performance and control over system resources. It is widely used for developing operating systems, games, real-time simulations, embedded systems, and other performance-critical applications.

C++ supports both low-level and high-level programming, combining the power of C with the features of object-oriented programming.

It is one of the foundational languages in computer science and software engineering.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features of C++:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction  
- **High performance**: Close to hardware, with manual memory management  
- **Multi-paradigm**: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming  
- **Compiled language**: Translates code directly into machine-level instructions  
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: A powerful collection of reusable classes and functions  
- **Cross-platform**: Can run on multiple operating systems with proper setup

### ðŸ§  Topics I'm Learning

#### ðŸ”¹ Variables and Data Types
Understanding how to declare and use different data types (int, float, char, etc.) and how variables store values in memory.

#### ðŸ”¹ Input/Output Operations
Learning how to take user input using `cin` and display output using `cout` with the help of the `<iostream>` library.

#### ðŸ”¹ Operators and Expressions
Exploring arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators to perform operations on data.

#### ðŸ”¹ Control Statements (if, switch, loops)
Using decision-making statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) to control program flow.

#### ðŸ”¹ Functions and Recursion
Creating reusable blocks of code using functions, and understanding recursive function calls for solving problems elegantly.

#### ðŸ”¹ Arrays and Strings
Storing multiple values using arrays and manipulating sequences of characters using C-style strings and `string` class.

#### ðŸ”¹ Pointers and Dynamic Memory
Learning how pointers work, accessing memory addresses, and managing memory dynamically using `new` and `delete`.

#### ðŸ”¹ Object-Oriented Concepts (Classes & Objects)
Grasping the basics of OOP including class definition, object creation, access specifiers, and encapsulation.

#### ðŸ”¹ Constructors and Destructors
Understanding how constructors initialize objects and destructors clean up resources when objects are destroyed.

#### ðŸ”¹ Inheritance and Polymorphism
Reusing code with inheritance, and achieving dynamic behavior through function overriding and virtual functions.

#### ðŸ”¹ File Handling
Reading from and writing to files using `fstream`, managing file streams, and understanding input/output modes.

#### ðŸ”¹ Templates and Exception Handling
Writing generic and reusable code using templates, and handling runtime errors safely using try-catch blocks.
