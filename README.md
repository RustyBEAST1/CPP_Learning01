ðŸ“˜ What is C++?
C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that provides high performance and control over system resources. It is widely used for developing operating systems, games, real-time simulations, embedded systems, and other performance-critical applications.

C++ supports both low-level and high-level programming, combining the power of C with the features of object-oriented programming.

It is one of the foundational languages in computer science and software engineering.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features of C++:
Object-Oriented Programming: Supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction

High performance: Close to hardware, with manual memory management

Multi-paradigm: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming

Compiled language: Translates code directly into machine-level instructions

Standard Template Library (STL): A powerful collection of reusable classes and functions

Cross-platform: Can run on multiple operating systems with proper setup
